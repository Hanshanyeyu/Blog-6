# Functional Light JS (轻量函数式编程) --- Kyle Simpson
> 不是技术笔记即使都是在讲技术，但是我会摘抄和自己翻译（胡编）一些经典句子下来， 因为我更想把自己带入这些技术大牛的思维里去，去理解和学习它，让我们开始吧

1.  Code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand. The reverse is true also: code that you don't understand is code you can't trust  
```js
你不能明白的代码，不可信！
//(原文好绕，一句话就是这个)
//(其实就在说: Functional programming is f**king pretty great. That is EASY to understand. Use it bro!)
```


2. It's widely estimated that developers spend 70% of code maintenance time on reading to understand it. That is eye-opening. 70%. No wonder the global average for a programmer's lines of code written per day is about 10. We spend up to 7 hours of our day just reading the code to figure out where those 10 lines should go!  
```js
天啊，真的是开眼了，程序员70%的时间都花在了阅读和理解别人代码（或者自己的），怪不得程序员平均每天写的代码量只有10行
```
